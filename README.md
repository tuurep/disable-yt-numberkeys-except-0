# Disable YouTube Seek by Number (Except 0)

This is a fork of https://github.com/timmontague/youtube-disable-number-seek

## Why?

The addon prevents losing your place on a video if you accidentally press a number key. But there were some of us who still wanted to use <kbd>0</kbd>, because it goes to the start of the video and is useful for quickly resetting a video from the beginning.

Fork born from the discussion in this issue: https://github.com/timmontague/youtube-disable-number-seek/issues/3

## Todo

Enable permissions for any YouTube frontend which has these keybinds

* done for example in [SponsorBlock](https://github.com/ajayyy/SponsorBlock)
